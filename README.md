## Summary

Adaptation of a simple network simulation model to COVID-19 (forked from https://github.com/magicicada/simple_network_sim to be brought into the SCRC consortium GitHub organisation - this, the SCRC owned repository is the main repository for development). Similar models have previously been used to model other disease outbreaks with different characteristics to COVID-19. 

The status of the software is reviewed against a [checklist](software_checklist.md).

In `simple_network_sim`, a geographical area (e.g. Scotland) is represented as a series of connected nodes in a network, each of which has a population, stratified by age group. Some nodes have more movement between them than others. The progress of the epidemic is modelled within nodes using compartments describing the number of people in various disease states within the node. There is one of these sets of compartments per node. As simulated time incrementally moves forward, the model predicts the number of people in each disease state in each node.

A more detailed [model overview is available](doc/model_documentation/model_description.pdf).

## Installation

Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (it also works with [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), but we do not need the extra packages). With conda installed, run the following commands to create the virtual environment and activate it:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate simple_network_sim
```

## Reproducible builds

In order to ensure reproducibility, we export a [spec-file.txt](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments) whenever we change dependencies for this project. The file pins the version for every dependency and subdependencies of the project.  Since the CI use that file to set up the environment, it is linux specific. A conda environment can be created with it by running:

```
conda create --name simple_network_sim --file spec-file.txt
conda activate simple_network_sim
```

The file can be created with the following command:

```
conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt
```

## Tests

Simple network sim has regression tests and unit tests. Regression tests ensure that changes to the code do not alter overall functionality in a simulated use case, compared with previous versions of the software. Unit tests ensure that individual components of the software (e.g. functions) work as intended. The current test regime does not check if model outputs are "correct" or "valid", merely that the software is working as expected.

### Test data

Test data is stored in `tests/test_data` and mirrors the structure of `sample_input_files/` - these files are not used in automated tests but provided to allow users to run simple network sim from the command line (`sample_output_files/` are also not part of automated testing). [Baseline test data](###Approach-to-regression-testing) is stored in `tests/regression/data`.

### Running the tests

After activating your conda environment, execute the following command:

```{shell}
pytest --cov=simple_network_sim tests
```

### Approach to regression testing

Our approach updating regression test data is based on matplotlib's `matplotlib.testing.decorators.image_comparison`.
The functions `tests.utils.compare_mpl_plots` and `tests.utils.create_baseline` are used to maintain the regression
test data. They both work very similarly. A regression test may look like this:

```python
def test_mytest():
    results_filename = do_some_computation()
    baseline_filename = create_baseline(results_filename)

    assert open(results_filename).read() == open(baseline_filename).read()
```

The `create_baseline` function will calculate the baseline filename for that test by using the test's name and path
(it figures that information out from an environment variable that pytest sets) and return it. If the file is not
present, then `create_baseline` will make the test fail, but it will copy the result's filename into the baseline
location. Otherwise, it will not make any changes to the baseline.

If you are altering a regression tests that existed before, you will need to deliberately remove the baseline file
(or use the `force_update` parameter so that it happens automatically) so that `create_baseline` will create it for
your. You will then need to validate the newly created file manually. If you didn't intend to have any effects in
regression tests when you made your changes, then you shouldn't do that, but find out what caused the test to fail
(running the test multiple times will always result in fail in this scenario).

If you're creating a regression test, the first time you run it, it will fail. You should then manually check the
resulting file before creating a PR. The second time you run your test in this scenario, it will succeed.

## Usage

### Running the model

To run a example case, enter the following at the command prompt:

```{shell}
python -m simple_network_sim.sampleUseOfModel
```

That will use the config.yaml file in the root directory. That file lists all
the parameters needed by the model. That will point to the
`sample_input_files`, which contains a set of sample files to run the model.
The real data requires downloading it from the data pipeline API (that step is
not yet ready).

Look at [sample_input_files/README.md](sample_input_files/README.md) for a
summary of the contents of the files.

Use the help command to see a description of all the parameters

```{shell}
python -m simple_network_sim.sampleUseOfModel -h
usage: sampleUseOfModel.py [-h] [--use-movement-multipliers] [--time TIME]
                           [-l LOGFILE] [-q] [--debug]
                           [-c DATA_PIPELINE_CONFIG]
                           ...

Uses the network of populations model to simulation the disease progression

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --use-movement-multipliers
                        By enabling this parameter you can adjust dampening or
                        heightening people movement through time (default:
                        False)
  --time TIME           The number of time steps to take for each simulation
                        (default: 200)
  -l LOGFILE, --logfile LOGFILE
                        Path for logging output (default: None)
  -q, --quiet           Prints only warnings to stderr (default: False)
  --debug               Provide debug output to STDERR (default: False)
  -c DATA_PIPELINE_CONFIG, --data-pipeline-config DATA_PIPELINE_CONFIG
                        Base directory with the input paramters (default:
                        config.yaml)
```

Descriptions of the data files used can be found in the [data dictionary](sample_input_files/README.md).

### Visualisation

You can visualise a previous run with the visualisation command. Eg.:

```shell
python -m simple_network_sim.network_of_populations.visualisation access-381ab6b4169c0357261103a7d52fc93b495e9af5.yaml
```

These are the parameters you can pass the visualisation command:

```shell
python -m simple_network_sim.network_of_populations.visualisation  --help
usage: visualisation.py [-h] [--nodes nodes,[nodes,...]]
                        [--states states,[states,...]] [--share-y]
                        [--data-product DATA_PRODUCT]
                        access_log_path

                        (default: False)
  --data-product DATA_PRODUCT
                        Use this to select which output file to read, in case
                        more than one is available (default:
                        output/simple_network_sim/outbreak-timeseries)
```


## Building the documentation

To build a local version of the readthedocs site (e.g. when working on the documentation) add the following packages to your environment:

- `sphinx`
- `sphinx_rtd_theme`

Then:

```{shell}
cd doc
sphinx-build -b html -d build/doctrees source build/html
```

## Building the latex documentation

To build the [latex document](doc/model_documentation/model_description.pdf), you need a recent installation of a latex distribution (e.g. MiKTeX, and an editor, e.g. TeXMaker), and use the "PDFLaTex" compiler to generate the pdf file, through the command:

```{shell}
pdflatex doc/model_documentation/model_description.tex
```

## Continuous integration

[Continuous integration uses Travis, codacy and Codecov](ci.md).

## Static analysis

[Automated static analysis results](https://app.codacy.com/gh/ScottishCovidResponse/simple_network_sim/issues/index) are available - these should be interpreted with caution and the importance of each issue must be assessed individually. The setup is to use pylint with a [configuration file](.pylintrc). This is the default plus we ignore C0103 (variable names) and C0301 (line lengths). We do not make use of the overall "quality standards" features of codacy at this time as they are pretty arbitrary.
