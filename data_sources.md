# Data Sources

This document is a list of data sources that are being used (or might be useful) for this model. Ultimately, the only data used for report-generating model runs will be via the [SCRC data pipeline](http://data.scrc.uk/).

Useful data includes non-disease-compartment parameters:
- Geographic areas in a Scotland/UK, populations, age structures, household makeups
- Pre-lockdown flow census computer movements
- Post-lockdown movement damping
- Pre-and-post lockdown age-mixing (e.g. comix)
